\section{Help-me-carry}
The robot's owner went shopping for groceries and needs help carrying the groceries from the car into the home.
The whole family helps, as well as the robot. 

\subsection{Goal}
The robot must bring some items from outside the arena inside the arena.

\subsection{Focus}
This test focuses on following and navigation in an unknown environment. 

\subsection{Setup}
The robot starts waiting inside the arena. 
The operator (the robot's owner) has a set of bags and boxes that need to be carried from a place outside the arena back inside. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Location:} One of the arenas (apartment) and its surroundings. The apartment is in its normal state. Part of the test is performed outside the arena in a public space.
  \item \textbf{Start:} Starting location of the robot. %%Close *to* the front door of the appartment?
  \item \textbf{Car:} The robots operator has put the groceries in the trunk of the car after shopping. The car is parked outside the home.
  \item \textbf{Destinations:} The items must be transported to places where they can be stored. The destinations are various rooms of the arena. 
  \item \textbf{Doors:} All doors in the apartment are open.
  \item \textbf{Operator:} A \quotes{professional} operator is selected by the TC to act as the operator of the robot. 
  \item \textbf{Other people:} There are no restrictions on other people walking by or standing around throughout the complete task. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task (OPL \& DSPL)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Start:} The robot is waiting somewhere in the apartment. The operator approaches the robot and tells it to follow. E.g. ``Robot, follow me''
\item \textbf{Following:} The robot starts following the operator, who guides the robot to the car containing the groceries. 
\item \textbf{Arrive at car:} When at the car, the operator tells the robot they have reached the car and to remember this location. E.g. ``Remember: this location is the car''. 
\item \textbf{Handover groceries:} The operator gives the robot a command to carry something, e.g. a box or a bag.  E.g. ``Carry this box''
  The robot puts up its arms and the operator gives the item to the robot.
\item \textbf{Command destination:} The operator tells where the given item should go, one of the rooms in the arena. E.g. ``Bring this to the kitchen''
\item \textbf{Delivery:} The robot then goes inside the house to deliver the item to the destination. 
\item \textbf{Guiding:} Close to the destination, a human will be waiting. The robot must ask the human for help in carrying stuff and the robot must guide that helping human to the car.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task (SSPL)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Start:} The robot is waiting somewhere in the apartment. The operator approaches the robot and tells it to follow. E.g. ``Robot, follow me''
	\item \textbf{Following:} The robot starts following the operator, who guides the robot to the car containing the groceries. 
	\item \textbf{Arrive at car:} When at the car, the operator tells the robot they have reached the car and to remember this location. E.g. ``Remember: this location is the car''. 
	\item \textbf{Asked for help:} The operator gives the robot a command to find help for unloading the car.  E.g. ``Ask Gary in the kitchen to help me''.
	The robot must go find a person in the commanded room. 
	\item \textbf{Asking for help:} The robot asks the person for help with carrying stuff.
	\item \textbf{Guiding:} The robot then guides the helper to the car.
\end{enumerate}

The robot may encounter some obstacles while navigating and the robot must deal and avoid or otherwise deal with the obstacle. 
The possible obstacles are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Small object:} Small object. For example, someone has dropped a piece of fruit (like an apple or mandarin) while carrying the groceries inside.
	\item \textbf{3D Object:} A bar table, normal table, rolling chair: some object that is wider at its top than on its bottom, 
	  thus requiring more than just a laser scanner mounted near the ground to avoid obstacles. 
	\item \textbf{Smart obstacle:} A person to whom the robot may speak to and kindly ask to move away. 
	  When interacting with people, the robot must look at the person and make clear is speaking with him/her.
	\item \textbf{Moving people:} As the whole family living in the house is helping getting the groceries from the car, 
	  additional to the robot there will be some people also going back and forth between the car and various rooms. 
	  The robot will encounter these and deal with them. These people are friendly to the robot and will not actively block it but the robot must also not block them. 
\end{itemize}
%% Possible extensions: 
%% - DONE: allow the operator to tell for each item where it should go
%% - At the destination room, there is a person waving, waiting for the robot to bring the items so (s)he can take them
%% - Points for a natural handover. E.g. the human is holding a box and the robot moves in to take it over instead of the humans placing it in the robots arms. Same for the bag
%% - Close the appartment door when the robot is inside?

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Delivering items:} At the destination, the robot may place the bag or box at a convenient location: the floor or a table
  \item \textbf{Obstacle avoidance:} The robot will encounter some human(s) on the way between the two locations.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee instructions}

The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
\item Distribute some objects over some boxes and shopping bags.
\item Destignate a few ``car parking locations'' from which the objects must be carried.
