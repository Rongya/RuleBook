\section{Storing Groceries}

The robot must store the groceries on their right place, which is where other objects of the same category are.

\subsection{Goal}
The robot has to correctly identify and manipulate objects at different heights, grouping them by category and likelihood.

\subsection{Focus}
This test focuses on the detection and recognition of objects and their features, as well as object manipulation.

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Location:} This test is run in one room of the arena, modified to have a table or trolley (at grasp distance) close to a shelf. The robot will start at a random distance between 1.0m and 1.5m from the bookcase.
\item \textbf{Cupboard:} Any shelf from the arena allocating 10 objects (3 known, 3 alike, 3 unknown, 1 container; see \ref{rule:scenario_objects}) grouped by category and likeliness. 
\item \textbf{Door:} The cupboard has a single door, which is initially closed. At least one object group is accessed through the door.
\item \textbf{Table:} Any table from the arena, having on top 10 shuffled objects (probably stacked, 3 known, 3 alike, 3 unknown, 1 container; see \ref{rule:scenario_objects})
\end{enumerate}

Please note that there may be more than one object in each shelf to fit all objects in, especially after the robot fills the shelves. 

\subsection{Task}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Reach the cupboard:} The robot approached to the cupboard (and the table) at grasp distance.
\item \textbf{Inspection:} The robot inspects both, the cupboard and the table.
\item \textbf{Opening door:} The robot opens the cupboard's door and announces which type of objects are stored inside.
\item \textbf{Moving objects:} The robot takes an object from the table and safely places it into the shelf (see Section \refsec{rule:scenario_objects}), close to the other objects in the shelf that belong to the same category. The robot must clearly announce the name and category of the object being moved.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Startup:} The robot starts with a Start Button (see Section \refsec{rule:start_signal})
  \item \textbf{Collisions:} Slightly touching the the cupboard is tolerated. However, the robot will be stopped immediately if it drives over or smashes the objects/shelf (see section \refsec{rule:safetyfirst}).
  \item \textbf{Cupboard specifications:} The cupboard is any shelf from the arena and has
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{DSPL}] At least 3 shelves between 0.90m and 1.50m from the ground.
    \item[\textbf{SSPL}] At least 3 shelves between 0.90m and 1.50m from the ground.
    \item[\textbf{OPL}] At least 5 shelves between 0.30m and 1.80m from the ground.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cupboard's door specifications:} The cupboard has a door that opens outside (i.e., not sliding). The door has a handle or knob is coloured to contrast with the shelve.
  \item \textbf{Recognition report:} Robots must create a report file in PDF format summarizing the the list of recognized objects, and containing the following information:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A picture of the scene where all recognized objects are labeled and enclosed in a bounding box.
    \item A picture showing each object, it's name/label, and category.
  \end{itemize}

  The report file must be delivered to the TC in a USB-stick after the test. The PDF file name should include the team name and a timestamp.  Objects in the report must be recognizable by a human (TC) so that it can be scored. In case of doubt, no points will be scored.
  \item \textbf{Clear area: } The robot may assume that the direct vicinity of the cupboard and table are clear and that the robot can move slightly backwards for its task. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data recording}
  Please record the following data (See \refsec{rule:datarecording}):
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Images
   \item Plans
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{OC instructions}

\textbf{2 hours before the test}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Anounce the startup location for robots.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Referee instructions}
The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
\item Place the objects in the cupboard and on the table.
\item Shut the cupboard's door.
\end{itemize}
